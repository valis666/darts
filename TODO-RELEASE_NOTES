Limited players names to 12 characters. Sorry !
Double-in/Double-out options appeared in game Ho-one. The best ones !

v 0.9
-------
/!\ This is more a stabilisation version. Goals where to clean code, stabilize features already present and correct bugs. Another goal was to ensure perenity of this game by migrating to python3.
Servers (Master and Game Server) are now tested on Windows
Full compat with python3 - fully tested on GNU/Linux. Less on Windows
Full rewrite of network server and client - more reliable :)
Random handling in Games is more easy than ever !
A few bugs in games are solved
GameOptions are not mandatory anymore to make the game usable - Kapital for exemple has no more Game Opts
All settings can be set two ways : Config file or CLI. If none of them is set, default take place. So there is no more issues with new options.
When you launch pydarts for the first time, if your dart board is plugged in, pydarts will tr to detect automaticaly your serial port
Change of CLI options format. Using now long options like this : "--debuglevel=" . Use pydarts.sh --help to see changes in CLI.
Fusion of some code among Client/Server/MasterServer
Possibility to use an alternate config file : "--config="
"nbdarts" is now a game setting. Every game can have a different number of darts to throw per round. Thats an exclusivity pydarts !
Starting from this version : if you do not play during 1 hour (network only), the server will close connection
Full rewrite of menus. No Network assistant needed now.
pyDarts is now localized. It will detect your locale and if a translation exists, it will automatically select it !
