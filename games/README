To create a game, you need (at least) :
*******************************
A file *.py in the "games" folder (Use the sample_game to understand game file structure).

Things to know when you want to create a game:
*********************************************************
You can extend the basic options of a player with a subclass with a reference to "CPlayer" MasterClass (See sample)
Game options can be "Boolean" or "Numeric" options.
Use the return code to inform the main game what's happening in your game :
Return Codes : 1 - Player has no more darts to throw (next player), but has played (=/=return code  4)
               2 - The game is over - nobody win or game interrupted
               3 - There is a winner (id of winner is returned in "objGame.winner" var)
               4 - The player will not play at all this round
You'll probably need to use PreDartsChecks method, actions run before the player throw his darts.
The PostDartsChecks method is the action done after each dart threw.
EarlyPlayerButton is a method used to execute actions if the player put a dart out of the dart board and then pressed the player button
GameStats and CheckRecord are optionnaly used to save Hi Scores and update them when a player reach one of them.
